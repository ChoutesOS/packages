# ChoutesOS package repository

The signed pacman repository of ChoutesOS. Every ChoutesOS system uses it automatically to receive new versions of the ChoutesOS desktop, tools, and themes, next to the updates from the Arch repositories.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is made for ChoutesOS only. Do not add it to other Arch-based systems.

## How ChoutesOS uses it

The packages and the repository database are published in the [`repo-x86_64`](https://github.com/ChoutesOS/packages/releases/tag/repo-x86_64) release of this repository. ChoutesOS reads the address from `/etc/pacman.d/choutesos-mirrorlist`, which comes with the `choutesos-release` package:

```ini
[choutesos]
Include = /etc/pacman.d/choutesos-mirrorlist

# /etc/pacman.d/choutesos-mirrorlist
Server = https://github.com/ChoutesOS/packages/releases/download/repo-$arch
```

The ChoutesOS Store of ChoutesOS checks this repository in the background at every start and installs its updates together with the other system updates. A new version of `choutesos-release` is a new version of ChoutesOS.
